The original challenge was to create a shareable project that would assist in buying and selling decisions for different stocks; it would address items including how volatile is a stock, and how much of that volatility can be accounted for as a leading or lag indicator from social media.  Also, discussed was what is the correlation and time-sensitivity of these and other factors? 

As the team lost members, we had to refocus our efforts and examine just one stock to keep the volume of data to a reasonable level.  In order to obtain the data and learn how best to refine it for our intended goals we used a small set of potential leading indicators of stock price performance. 

We originally began looking for a free and easy means to obtain information to be able complete this task.  The research led the group to discover the IEX platform ("Data provided by IEX Cloud”) which had most of the desired data sets.  This is a paid for service, but is very timely in its information, therefore became the path we selected.

Stock prices have a great deal of interest, (The U.S. stock market is currently $34 trillion, compared to the rest of the world's $44 trillion in capital. The U.S. holds 43% of world market value, but it houses only 17% of the world's stocks.) there are several pricing models available that could cause a price performance impact. A list to show the potential different price models can be found at: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pricing_strategies. Stock prices are determined in the marketplace, where seller supply meets buyer demand. But have you ever wondered about what drives the stock market—that is, what factors affect a stock's price? Unfortunately, there is no clean equation that tells us exactly how a stock price will behave. That said, we do know a few things about the forces that move a stock up or down. These forces fall into three categories: fundamental factors, technical factors, and market sentiment.  It is this last area were the team is focused to see if the data is available to find a leading indicator - market sentiment.

This project is not to teach the user any financial terms, formulas or theories; it is to determine if a leading indicator can be obtained from social media. Not all social media formats will be selected, just those that offer easy, fast and potentially free access to current trends. 

Lastly, as we are all workings toward increasing our data science understanding, the data is being gathered and formatted to conduct the first of many potential analyses.  Regression analysis: which will examine the influence / correlation of one or more independent parameter(s) on a dependent parameter(s). If a correlation is found, next would be predictive analyses, using predictive modelling, or potentially machine learning methods, to determine if social media is a leading or lagging indicator of stock price performance; and if so what are the constrains around such a model.

This project is a beta release from a DSCI511 Group Team Project; their data dictionary and methods for obtaining information used to try to detect leading indicator of price performance.

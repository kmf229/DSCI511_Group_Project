# DSCI511 Group Project Data Dictionary 

#### The read me document stated there are three basic areas where stock prices are influenced: fundamental factors, technical factors, and market sentiment.

IEX is able to provide information in all three areas, the details of which can be found at: https://www.investopedia.com/articles/basics/04/100804.asp

Based on the IEX data available (“Data provided by IEX Cloud”) from the service level purchased, there is a larger volume of information to be obtained. The time period varies from years to microseconds depending upon the information sought.  The stock price information is one of the items that is highly sensitive to time and is part of the microsecond information available intraday. This converts to X minutes outside of intraday request.

Using team developed data pulled based on IEX API these are the data tables created. They can be used wholly or partially for additional investigation: 
Data available: amzn_balance_sheet.csv, amzn_cashflow.csv, amzn_company.csv, amzn_earnings.csv, amzn_estimates.csv, amzn_stats.csv, chart_data.csv, financials.csv, income_statement.csv, insider_transations.csv 
options_201911.csv, options_201912.csv, options_202001.csv, options_202002.csv, options_202003.csv, options_202004.csv, options_202006.csv, options_202007.csv, options_202009.csv, options_202101.csv, options_202106.csv, options_202201.csv, peers.csv, price_target.csv, recommendation_trends.csv and sentiments.csv

Each of the csv file details are shared below. It is worth noting that these definitions are provided by IEX and are reasonably standard, but finance definitions are not as well defined as the scientific definitions.
